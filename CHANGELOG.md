## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-10

`orglens start UNIT` picks one of the unit's homes, launches through scad, and
records the unit before the session's first turn. Unless `--prompt` is given,
that first turn names the unit, lists its homes, and points at where its status
is written.

Containment attributes a session when its working directory sits inside exactly
one home. Where it does not, the session stays unattributed.

- `orglens declare PATH` proposes a declaration from a directory's position,
  shows the reason for each guess, and asks before writing.
- `orglens config UNIT` renders a unit's homes into the `repos:` block a
  container launcher reads.
- `orglens new` takes `--home`, repeatable.
- Attribution events are stored in `~/.orglens/events/`, one file per session.
- The deck bank keeps `tutorial`. The other decks moved to a private repo.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-14

A unit of work declares itself in a `.orglens.yml` and names the places it
lives. Its documents, sessions and state are derived from those. A home is a
name that resolves to a path on the machine you are on.
